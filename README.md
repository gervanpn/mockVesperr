# mockVesperr - Gervan Nantel
School assignment for April 7

https://github.com/gervanpn/mockVesperr

Build a responsive website, using the principles discussed.
	• A responsive website should include a grid system, media queries, and images that resize.
		○ Your grid system and media queries should be custom-coded.
		○ The grid system must have at least 3 columns. It can have as many as you want.
		○ You should include at least three unique media queries in your CSS. You may have more than this if you require it. You may repeat the same media query more than once, but that doesn't count towards "unique" media queries.
		○ The images that resize may be a solution that you download, or the HTML5 solution. Use a solution from class, or use another solution you’ve found that you like better. You must resize at least one image in the site.
	• The site should include a navigation bar that links the relevant pages together, and it should be available on all pages of the site.
	• The click on the Contact Us should  prompt alert window
	• Extra 5% will be given if your menu has at least one dropdown.
	• The site should work in some combination of Mac or PC, Firefox or Chrome.
This assignment may be completed in groups or individually.
This assignment is due on April 7 before 5 pm
